Roll your own challenge
=======================

If your the creative type or simply want to choose another challenge other than what we have listed feel free to do so.  Please submit your own solution and be prepared to answer questions on the code.  We prefer submissions written in Java, Perl, Python, or Ruby.  You can use C/C++ or shell scripts as well.

Some good places to find coding challenges are:

-  [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler")
-  [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/ "Ruby Quiz")
-  [Code Chef](http://www.codechef.com/ "Code Chef")

Please make sure that you provide a pointer back to the description of your challenge and provide a set of unit tests to prove out the functionality.  After all we believe in TDD, so coding and testing are one in the same.
